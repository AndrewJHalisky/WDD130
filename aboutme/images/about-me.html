    <h2>Andrew Halisky</h2>
    <p>Hello there! My name is Andrew Halisky and I am from just above Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I am majoring in Applied Technology with hopes to pursuit a career in web development. Some things I enjoy doing are playing computer/video games either by myself or with family. I also enjoy exercising, wathcing sports on TV (my must-watches are hockey and football), and doing Family History!</p>
    <p>I am taking this course to further my knowledge of the basics of how websites are built. I am new to HTML, but I already find it very interesting and I am excited to learn more throughout this course.<p>
    <p>I was born and raised in the church and served a 2-year service mission here in the Philadelphia area. My favorite scritpure is Matthew 5:16 where it says "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven." I really like this scripture because it states that if we are good examples and serve others, then others will be inspired to do the same thing and continue to help build the kingdom.</p>
    <p>I am excited to learn and grow throughout this course and get to know many of you as well!</p>
