        Why will people come to your site?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Face-it! By Andrew can provide a unique idea for party planners.  Guests can choose from a variety of ways they would like to have themselves caricatured.  At the end of the evening, they will all get to go home with a gift.
        We also provide one-time caricatures for gift givers who are looking for that perfect and very different gift idea.  
      </p>
      <h4>
        Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions? 
      </h4>
      <p>
        People are tired of boring gifts and party activities.  They want to provide unique experiences and show their friends and family that they really put some thought into their gift giving.  When they see how an activity like this can be for their party, they will choose this over other activities.
