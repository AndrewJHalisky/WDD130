                Why caricatures? 
            </h4>
            <p>
                People are tired of boring gifts and party activities.  They want to provide unique experiences and show their friends and family that they really put some thought into their gift giving.  When they see how an activity like this can be for their party, they will choose this over other activities. 
            </p>
            <h4>
                Why our caricatures are so awesome!
